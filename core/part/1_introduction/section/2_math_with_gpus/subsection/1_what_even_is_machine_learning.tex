\subsection{Wait... What Even \textit{Is} Machine Learning?}

Someone once asked me:

\begin{quote}
\textit{You do machine learning, right? We’re thinking of using AI to streamline our end-to-end analytics stack. Does that mean we need, like, a neural Kubernetes layer or something?}
\end{quote}

And... I'm not even mad. Because if you’ve ever sat in a corporate meeting where someone says “we should add some AI,” followed immediately by “and also maybe some hadoop,” you know exactly how surreal this space can feel.

We’ve managed to take centuries of deeply anxious math and wrap it in a marketing smoothie of buzzwords, synergy, and phrases that sound like they came from a randomized LinkedIn generator.

So let’s do something dangerous: let’s stop pretending this makes sense and actually look under the hood.

Because what machine learning really is (at its mathematical core) is far simpler, and far weirder, than most people expect.

And to explain it, we’ll need to go back. Way back. To when math itself fell apart.

  Buzzword Bingo is older than you'd think.

  \medskip
  
  While the modern version thrives in tech meetings—where terms like “synergize,” “AI-powered,” and “Kubernetes-native” ricochet off whiteboards—it has deep roots in the rituals of professional jargon.

  \medskip
  
  Its earliest ancestor may be the postwar managerial lingo of the 1950s, when phrases like “core competencies” and “strategic alignment” first strutted onto the stage of corporate theater. By the 1980s, consultants wielded language like a magic wand: \textit{restructuring}, \textit{optimization}, and \textit{value-added} became incantations to summon budget approvals.

  \medskip
  
  The phrase “Buzzword Bingo” itself emerged in the 1990s as a satirical game, where employees silently filled out bingo cards as executives delivered keynotes full of hollow hype. Think: \textit{paradigm shift}, \textit{scalability}, \textit{leveraging synergies}.

  \medskip
  
  Today, the tradition is alive and well—but digitized. Engineers now covertly tap their phones under the table, using Buzzword Bingo apps that light up when someone says “neural ontology graph” or “real-time value extraction.” A few even keep score. It's less about cynicism and more about survival.

  \medskip
  
  Because when the slide deck hits slide 87 and someone starts evangelizing a “blockchain-enabled thought pipeline,” you need a coping mechanism.
