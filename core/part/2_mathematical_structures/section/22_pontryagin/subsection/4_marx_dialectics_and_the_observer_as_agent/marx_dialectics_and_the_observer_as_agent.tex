\subsection{Pontryagin and the Dialectics of Control:  
When Marxist Determinism Found Its Steering Wheel}

The Enlightenment gave us a universe of clockwork certainty—reflected in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. In this worldview, nature unfolds along predetermined paths, optimizing some abstract quantity like "action," while mathematicians stand at a safe distance, notebooks in hand, merely recording the inevitable.

But Karl Marx shattered that passivity. Drawing from Hegelian dialectics, Marx insisted that systems—especially human and historical ones—aren’t inert mechanisms; they are arenas of conflict, contradiction, and transformation. The observer isn’t outside the system—they’re embedded within it, capable of intervention. History wasn’t to be observed. It was to be made.

\medskip

This dialectical spirit found an unlikely mathematical ally in the mid-20\textsuperscript{th} century:  
\textbf{Lev Pontryagin}, a brilliant Soviet mathematician and a committed Marxist-Leninist.

Pontryagin didn’t just advance control theory—he redefined it. His \textbf{Maximum Principle} formalized how dynamic systems could be steered optimally toward desired outcomes. Unlike classical mechanics, where trajectories are fated by initial conditions, Pontryagin’s framework introduced **control variables**—handles through which an agent could influence the system’s evolution.

\medskip

This wasn’t merely mathematics. It was ideology expressed in equations.

For Pontryagin, control theory resonated with Leninist philosophy. Marxism-Leninism viewed history as deterministic—driven by material conditions and class struggle—but it also championed the role of revolutionary agency. The future was not a passive outcome; it was something to be seized, directed, and optimized.

\textit{Leninism is determinism—with a steering wheel.}
\end{quote}

Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle captured this perfectly:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The system evolves according to deterministic laws (reflecting material conditions).
  \item But within those laws, an agent applies optimal controls (the revolutionary vanguard).
  \item The goal: steer history—or any dynamic process—toward a prescribed, ideal state.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Mathematics as Revolutionary Praxis}

In the Soviet context, this wasn’t abstract theorizing. Control theory became a tool for planned economies, industrial output, spaceflight trajectories, and ideological narratives. It embodied the belief that with enough mathematical precision and centralized direction, chaos could be tamed, and history itself could be governed.

Pontryagin's work blurred the line between observer and participant, between describing the world and reshaping it. Where Western science often maintained a veneer of neutrality, Soviet science—armed with dialectical materialism—embraced mathematics as a force of will.

In classical mechanics:  
\quad The future unfolds. You calculate it.

In Pontryagin’s world:  
\quad The future is programmable. You steer it.

\textbf{Determinism doesn’t mean inevitability—it means control.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{The Observer Becomes the Operator}

Pontryagin’s contribution marks a philosophical pivot:

\begin{itemize}
  \item From passive observation to active intervention.
  \item From predicting trajectories to prescribing them.
  \item From describing what \textit{is} to optimizing what \textit{ought to be}.
\end{itemize}

Where Newton gave us a universe to watch, Pontryagin—true to his Marxist-Leninist roots—gave us a framework to \textbf{command} it.

\emph{Why settle for predicting history, when you can write its equations—and drive it?}
