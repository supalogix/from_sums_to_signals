\section{Consultant Culture: Weaponizing Management Theory One Slide at a Time}

There’s a certain elegance in how consultants operate.  Not elegance in the \textit{engineering} sense—where elegance means simplicity, efficiency, and robustness.  No, this is the kind of elegance you find in a magician’s sleight of hand or a well-executed con.

Consultant culture thrives at the intersection of \textbf{management theory}, \textbf{buzzwords}, and a deep understanding of one timeless truth:  
\begin{quote}
\textit{Power belongs to those who sound like they know what they’re doing.}
\end{quote}

If you’ve ever read \textbf{\textit{The 48 Laws of Power}}, you’ll recognize the playbook:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Law 6: Court Attention at All Costs} — Why explain clearly when you can dazzle with jargon?
  \item \textbf{Law 30: Make Your Accomplishments Seem Effortless} — Hence the rise of ``One-Click AI.''
  \item \textbf{Law 32: Play to People's Fantasies} — Enter ``Digital Transformation'' and ``AI Disruption.''
  \item \textbf{Law 45: Preach the Need for Change, but Never Reform Too Much at Once} — The eternal pilot project strategy.
\end{itemize}

Consultants don’t just follow these laws: they’ve industrialized them.  Where management theory once sought to optimize workflows and align strategy, consultants saw an opportunity:  

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Why optimize when you can monetize confusion?}
\end{quote}

Modern consulting has mastered the art of turning abstract management principles into recurring revenue streams:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Take a simple concept, dress it up in \textbf{synergies}, \textbf{frameworks}, and \textbf{paradigm shifts}.
  \item Build a strategy that ensures you're indispensable—but never accountable.
  \item Redefine success as a feeling, not a measurable outcome.
\end{itemize}

And when in doubt? Quote Drucker, mention agility, and remind everyone that \textit{``in today’s fast-paced digital landscape, transformation is a journey.''}

In this guide, I’m going to show you exactly how this game is played. We’ll dissect the tactics—one buzzword, one dashboard, and one eternal proof of concept at a time. Not to admire them, but so you’ll recognize when you're not buying innovation -- you’re buying \textbf{well-dressed ambiguity}.

Welcome to the backstage tour of consultant culture.

Let’s begin.

  Robert Greene didn’t start out trying to write a guide to power.  He started out trying to survive it.

  \medskip
  
  In the 1990s, while working in Hollywood and media production, Greene saw up close how success actually operated.  It wasn’t about servant leadership. It wasn’t about humility.  It was about leverage, illusion, and the careful orchestration of appearances.

  \medskip
  
  One day, while working at a media lab in Italy, Greene voiced his jaded views about leadership to a Dutch publisher named Joost Elffers.  He argued — bluntly — that powerful people don't play by the rules they teach others.  They weaponize the rules.

  \medskip
  
  Elffers immediately saw the potential.  Here was a philosophy that cut through the polite fictions of business books and self-help seminars — raw, unsentimental, and disturbingly accurate.

  \medskip
  
  Elffers convinced Greene to turn his worldview into a book, funded its development, and helped bring it to life.

  \medskip
  
  The result was \textbf{\textit{The 48 Laws of Power}} (1998): a work so brutally honest about human nature that it became an underground classic in boardrooms, backrooms, and battlefields alike.

  \medskip
  
  Greene didn’t invent consultant culture.  He just wrote down the rules everyone was already following, but no one wanted to admit.
