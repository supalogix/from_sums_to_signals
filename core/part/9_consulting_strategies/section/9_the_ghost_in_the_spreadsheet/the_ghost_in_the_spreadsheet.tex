\ExecutiveChecklist{high}{Preventing the Spreadsheet Ghost}{
  \item Ask what happens when the model fails—who’s accountable?
  \item Demand pre-analysis of the dataset before model promises.
  \item Require a plan for data hygiene, not just a shrug and a dashboard.
  \item If “garbage in, AI out” is the fallback—walk away.
