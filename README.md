I have the following sections about mathematical uncertainty 
 * laplace
 * boole
 * venn
 * fisher
 * shannon
 * kullback and liebler
 * jeffries
 * nash
 * jordan
 * amari

I want to create a section that talks about praxeology.
Introduce what the philisophical category is and how mathematicians had their own problems of "how do act when things are uncertain?"
each of these people had particular views of what how to come to deal with the unknown and created a mathematics based on it.
we are going to go through a historical overview and show you the evolution of thought about that
each person stood on the giants before them. 
The mathematics these people developed ultimately are used in machine learning and understanding the history of how we got here will help
This is important because machine leaning is really about making machines behave like us, but do we even know how we behave


give me the latex
