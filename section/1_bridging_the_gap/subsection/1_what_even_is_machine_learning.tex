\subsection{Wait... What Even \textit{Is} Machine Learning?}

Someone recently asked me:

\begin{quote}
\textit{"You do machine learning, right? We’re thinking of using AI to streamline our end-to-end analytics stack. Does that mean we need, like, a neural Kubernetes layer or something?"}
\end{quote}

I'm not even mad.

Because if you’ve ever sat in a corporate meeting where someone says “we should add some AI,” followed immediately by “and also maybe some hadoop,” you know exactly how surreal this space can feel.

We’ve managed to take centuries of deeply anxious math and wrap it in a marketing smoothie of buzzwords, synergy, and phrases that sound like they came from a randomized LinkedIn generator.


So let’s do something dangerous: let’s stop pretending this makes sense and actually look under the hood.

Because what machine learning really is (at its mathematical core) is far simpler, and far weirder, than most people expect.

And to explain it, we’ll need to go back. Way back. To when math itself fell apart.
