\section{Cantor’s Set Theory and the Problem of Pathological Sets (1874 --- 1883)}

\subsection{How Cantor Broke Infinity (and Everyone Else's Brain)}

If Fourier series had shaken classical analysis, Georg Cantor came along and absolutely wrecked it. He didn’t just uncover weird mathematical creatures—he introduced an entirely new way of thinking about size itself. 

Cantor’s big idea? \textbf{Cardinality}—the notion of measuring the "size" of a set, even when that set is infinite.

Before Cantor, infinity was treated as one big, hazy concept. Infinite was infinite. End of story. But Cantor asked a radical question:

\begin{quote}
    \textit{What if some infinities are bigger than others?}
\end{quote}

And then he answered it: they are.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=black!80!white, title={Historical Sidebar: Kant and the Limits of Infinity}]

  \textbf{Immanuel Kant} (1724–1804) argued that infinity could never be a completed object — only a process. In his view, the infinite exists merely as a \textit{regulative idea} of reason: useful for organizing thought, but never actually realized in nature or mathematics.
  
  For Kant, the mind can imagine counting forever, but it can never conceive of “all numbers” as a finished totality.
  
  \medskip
  
  \textbf{Georg Cantor} would later reject this view outright — insisting that the infinite was not just a mental process, but a mathematical reality.

\end{figure}





\subsection{Infinity 2.0: Now With More Infinities}

Cantor showed that the set of \textbf{rational numbers} (fractions) could be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={font=\small},>=Latex]

% Rational number matrix (3x3)
\matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes, row sep=1cm, column sep=1cm, nodes={anchor=center}] {
    \frac{1}{1} & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{3} \\
    \frac{2}{1} & \frac{2}{2} & \frac{2}{3} \\
    \frac{3}{1} & \frac{3}{2} & \frac{3}{3} \\
};

% Natural numbers

\node (n1) at (-2.5,1) {$2$};
\node (n2) at (-2.5,0) {$3$};
\node (n3) at (-2.5,-1) {$4$};
\node (n4) at (-2.5,-2) {$5$};
\node (dots) at (-2.5,-2.7) {$\vdots$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{A one-to-one correspondence between $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$}
\end{figure}


So even though there are infinitely many rationals, they are \textbf{countably infinite}. You can list them—eventually, you’ll get to any one you name.



But the set of \textbf{real numbers}? No chance. Cantor proved—through his famous diagonal argument—that there is no way to list all the real numbers. There are simply too many. They are \textbf{uncountably infinite}.










\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=black!80!white, title={Historical Sidenote: Nicholas of Cusa and the Paradox of the Infinite}]

  \textbf{Nicholas of Cusa} (1401–1464), a Renaissance cardinal and mystic philosopher, proposed a radical idea for his time: that the infinite is beyond comprehension not because it is vague, but because it is \textit{too precise} — too complete, too whole, too absolute.
  
  In his work \textit{De Docta Ignorantia} (“On Learned Ignorance”), Cusa described God as an **infinite circle whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere**. He believed that the infinite cannot be approached by finite reasoning — that all human knowledge of it must be paradoxical, asymptotic, and indirect.
  
  \medskip
  
  Though separated by centuries, Cusa’s theology of divine infinity echoed in Cantor’s conviction that the **absolute infinite** could be conceived only as a concept in the mind of God — beyond mathematics, beyond measure, but not beyond meaning.
  
\end{tcolorbox}
  












\subsection{An Example: Diagonalization}

But Cantor wasn’t done. He then pulled out his diagonalization argument: the real mic-drop moment. He showed that even if you tried to list every real number between 0 and 1, you could always construct a new number not in the list by modifying its decimal (or binary) expansion.

This is the structure of Cantor’s diagonal argument
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Assume}: All real numbers in $(0,1)$ can be listed as binary sequences
	\item \textbf{Diagonal Construction}: Create a new binary sequence $r$ by flipping the $n$th digit of $r_n$
	\item \textbf{New Sequence}:  $r$ differs from every $r_n$ in at least one digit
	\item \textbf{Contradiction}: $r$ is not in the list
	\item \textbf{Conclusion}: Real numbers in $(0,1)$ are uncountable
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}










Let’s walk through a specific example of how Cantor’s diagonalization argument works in practice: using binary numbers between 0 and 1. 

\textbf{The goal?} Outsmart someone who claims they’ve listed them all. 

\textbf{Your mission:} construct a binary number that’s guaranteed to be missing from their list.

Now, let’s see how this showdown plays out...

\begin{verbatim}
user1: Alright, I've done it. I've listed *every* binary number 
        between 0 and 1. All of them. Every. Single. One.

user2: Oh? Bold claim. Mind if I test it?

user1: Be my guest. Pick any number — it’s already on the list. Trust me.

*** [cue dramatic zoom] ***
(You, the thoughtful skeptic, lean in. You know exactly how to break this.)

user2: Okay, here’s what I’ll do. I’m going to take the first digit 
        of the first number, the second digit of the second number, 
        the third of the third… you get the idea.

user1: Uh... sure. Knock yourself out.

user2: And now I’m going to flip each of those digits.
        If it’s a 1, I make it 0. If it’s 0, I make it 1.

user1: Wait… what?

user2: I call it the “Diagonal Flip of Doom.” 
        The number I just created is different from every number 
        in your list — at least one digit is off in each row.

user1: -_-

user2: So your list? Not complete. You missed mine.

*** [4th wall commentary] ***
No matter how you try to list all the real numbers between 0 and 1 
in binary, someone can always pull this move — flipping the diagonals 
and creating a number that *can’t* be on the list.

user1: So you're saying... my infinite list... isn't infinite enough?

user2: Exactly. Welcome to uncountability, my friend. :)
\end{verbatim}


\medskip

\noindent
\textbf{Conclusion:} You win the game. There’s no way to list all the real numbers. There are simply \textit{too many of them}. That’s what it means for them to be \textbf{uncountable}.

\subsection{The Infinite Outsider: Cantor and the Cost of a New Reality}


This led him to introduce the concept of \textbf{infinite cardinalities}, and with it, the now-iconic symbols: the \textbf{aleph numbers}.

\[
\aleph_0\ (\text{aleph-null}) = \text{the cardinality of the natural numbers}
\]

This was the smallest level of infinity: the size of any set you can count, even if it takes forever.

But the real numbers? They’re on another level entirely. A bigger kind of infinite. Cantor didn’t assign a specific aleph to that size—but he knew it was strictly greater than $\aleph_0$.

\[
\text{cardinality of the real numbers} > \aleph_0
\]

Cantor believed the real numbers had cardinality $\aleph_1$—the next step up from $\aleph_0$—a claim known as the \textbf{Continuum Hypothesis}, which remains one of the most famous open questions in mathematics (or rather, one of the most famously undecidable).





\textbf{Infinity, it turned out, came in layers.} And this revelation didn’t win him much praise at the time.





Instead of a Fields Medal, Cantor earned a long list of critics. Many of his contemporaries found the very idea of different infinities absurd—even dangerous. Some accused him of corrupting mathematics with metaphysical nonsense. The stress eventually led to periods of mental illness and professional exile.

But today, we recognize his work as a turning point. Cantor didn’t just discover a new branch of mathematics—he invented the language we now use to talk about the infinite.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=black!80!white, title={Historical Sidenote: Augustine and the Eternal Infinite}]

  \textbf{St. Augustine} (354–430) believed that mathematical truths — including number, order, and infinity — reside not in the material world, but in the \textit{eternal mind of God}. In works like \textit{Confessions} and \textit{De Libero Arbitrio}, he argued that God’s knowledge is infinite, immediate, and timeless — containing all numbers, all outcomes, all truths at once.
  
  \medskip
  
  This theological framework profoundly influenced \textbf{Cantor}, who often described the **“absolute infinite”** not as a quantity, but as a reflection of God’s perfection. For Cantor, the infinite was real because it was first and foremost a **divine idea**.

\subsection{The Cantor Set }

To understand why Cantor’s discoveries were so unsettling, let’s look at the \textbf{Cantor set}—one of the first mathematical objects to give analysts an existential crisis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Start with the interval \( [0,1] \).
    \item Remove the middle third, leaving two intervals: \( [0,1/3] \cup [2/3,1] \).
    \item Remove the middle third from each remaining interval, and repeat indefinitely.
\end{itemize}

Or, more mathematically, What remains is a \textbf{nowhere-dense} set: no intervals, no clusters, just infinitely many points that never add up to anything continuous.

\end{figure}


In normal language? It’s a set so weird that it contains infinitely many points but takes up no space. It was the first clear example that classical ideas about "size" completely fell apart under set theory.

How do we know it has cardinality as the real numbers? One way to prove it is by recognizing that every point in the Cantor set corresponds to a decimal number made up only of 0s and 2s.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each constructed decimal number corresponds to a point in the real interval $[0,1]$.
	\item Since the set of infinite binary sequences has the same cardinality of the reals, so does the Cantor set.
\end{enumerate}

To get a feel for just how strange the Cantor set really is, imagine you’re chatting with someone who claims to understand it perfectly. Naturally, you're curious — after all, it's supposed to be a set that's both "infinitely full" and yet takes up no space at all. What follows is a conversation where you try to wrap your head around this bizarre construction, and end up questioning whether "size" even makes sense when infinity is involved.


{\ttfamily
\textbf{user1:} Ever heard of the Cantor set?

\textbf{user2:} No, what is it?

\textbf{user1:} It’s a set of numbers between 0 and 1 that contains infinitely many points...

\textbf{user2:} Okay...

\textbf{user1:} ...but has size zero.

\textbf{user2:} Uh, what? That’s nonsense. How can something have infinite points and still be size zero?

\textbf{user1:} Depends on what you mean by “size.”

\textbf{user2:} I mean, if it's got stuff in it, shouldn’t it take up space?

\textbf{user1:} Not necessarily. The Cantor set is built by removing the middle third over and over — forever. What’s left is dust.

\textbf{user2:} But infinite dust?

\textbf{user1:} Exactly. Infinitely many points, but no length. You could never “bump into it” by picking a random number.

\textit{*** [4th wall commentary] ***}

(It turns out our usual idea of “size” doesn’t work here — the Cantor set is a set full of points, but somehow takes up no space at all.)

\textbf{user2:} So it’s tiny?

\textbf{user1:} In one sense, yeah. But in another — get this — it’s actually the same size as the real numbers between 0 and 1.

\textbf{user2:} NOPE. I’m out. That makes zero sense.

\textbf{user1:} Here's the trick: Every number in the Cantor set can be written in base 3 using only 0s and 2s.

\textbf{user2:} Like binary, but skip the 1s?

\textbf{user1:} Exactly. And there are just as many of those infinite strings as there are real numbers.

\textbf{user2:} So it’s... empty but full. Small but huge.

\textbf{user1:} Welcome to set theory. :)

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=black!80!white, title={Historical Sidebar: Dedekind and Cantor — Architects of the Infinite Continuum}]

  In the late 19th century, mathematics underwent a foundational shift — one that redefined not just how we compute, but what numbers \textit{are}.
  
  \textbf{Richard Dedekind} (1831–1916) constructed the real numbers using what he called \textbf{cuts} in the rational line — partitioning \( \mathbb{Q} \) into two sets whose separation defined an irrational point. This method made the continuum rigorous: a seamless number line built from logical partitions.
  
  \medskip
  
  \textbf{Georg Cantor} (1845–1918), working around the same time, approached the infinite from the opposite direction. Where Dedekind built the continuum by filling in gaps, Cantor **classified infinities themselves** — showing that the continuum had a distinct, higher cardinality than the countable rationals.
  
  \medskip
  
  The two men were close collaborators and deep admirers of each other’s work. Dedekind even helped Cantor publish his early papers and was one of the first to grasp the philosophical depth of his ideas.
  
  Together, they gave mathematics a modern foundation:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Dedekind} formalized continuity.

\subsection{Cantor vs. Kronecker: The Math Feud of the Century}

At this point, you might expect Cantor to have been showered with mathematical awards. Instead, he became the most controversial mathematician in Europe. His biggest enemy? Leopold Kronecker.  

Kronecker, a powerful German mathematician, absolutely despised Cantor’s ideas. He believed that only finite, constructive mathematics was valid and called Cantor a "scientific charlatan." (Yes, that’s an actual quote.)  

But Kronecker wasn’t just throwing insults—he actively sabotaged Cantor’s career:

\begin{itemize}
    \item He blocked Cantor from getting a professorship in Berlin.
    \item He prevented his papers from being published in certain journals.
    \item He used his influence to make Cantor’s work look like academic heresy.
\end{itemize}

And the worst part? It worked. Cantor became increasingly isolated. 


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white, colframe=black!80!white, title={Historical Sidenote: Constructivism and the Paradox of the Fixed Point}]

  \textbf{Constructivism} is a philosophy of mathematics that insists: to say something exists, you must be able to \textit{construct it}. No appeals to abstract infinities, no non-constructive proofs — only explicit methods, grounded in arithmetic and logic.
  
  This view traces back to \textbf{Kronecker}, and later became central to thinkers like \textbf{Brouwer}, who founded intuitionism in the early 20th century.
  
  \medskip
  
  But many classical theorems defy this approach. One famous example is the \textbf{Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem}, which says:
  
  \begin{quote}
  \textit{Any continuous function from a closed disk to itself has at least one fixed point.}
  \end{quote}
  
  The proof is elegant — but non-constructive. It tells us the fixed point exists, but not how to find it.
  
  \medskip
  
  To a constructivist, this is a problem. Where’s the point? How do you get it? Mathematics, they argue, should not make promises it can’t keep.
  
  Yet the fixed point theorem remains indispensable — in economics, differential equations, game theory, and beyond. Its power lies precisely in its abstract generality — a kind of existence proof that constructivism, on principle, refuses to accept.

\subsection{Cantor’s Later Years: Genius, Madness, and... Shakespeare?}

The constant academic hostility took a toll. Cantor suffered sever mental illness, and was repeatedly institutionalized.

Oh, and did I mention he became obsessed with proving that Shakespeare’s plays were actually written by Francis Bacon? Yes, really. While revolutionizing mathematics, Cantor was also writing academic articles trying to debunk Shakespeare. Very sane. 

Cantor had revolutionized mathematics, but at the cost of his career, his mental health, and, quite possibly, his sanity. His story is a cautionary tale: sometimes, being right doesn’t mean you’ll be accepted. And sometimes, your biggest enemies aren’t your ideas: they’re the gatekeepers who don’t want to hear them.
